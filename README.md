# InterestCalculator
This application prompts the user for input and creates a table of data showing the power of compound interest.
I think that on this project I did particularly well on the menu loop.
I believe the code could be enhanced by adding more menu options for the user, such as an option to see only the end result instead of printing the end result of every year or month.
I think the most challenging part to write is just formatting the data into an easy to read table. It isn't really hard as much as a little bit tedious. 
One skill that is particularly transferable is the menu loop. I often copy and paste the menu loop code from this project into any new projects that need a menu.
This makes the code very adaptable to many programs where the user must make a choice.
